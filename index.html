        // Exercise 1:
//Write a JavaScript program to extract the first half of a given array and show the output in new   
// variable "categories_firsthalf"
 //let categories = ["Health", "Fashion", "Toys", "Electronic", "TV", "Sports", "Watches", "Motorbike", 
 //"Home and Lifestyle", "Devices"]

let categories = ["Health", "Fashion", "Toys", "Electronic", "TV", "Sports", "Watches", "Motorbike", "Home and Lifestyle", "Devices"]
let categories_firsthalf = ["Health", "Fashion", "Toys", "Electronic", "TV"]   
 console.log(categories_firsthalf) 
 
//Exercise 2:
//Write a JavaScript program to concatenate two array except their first index.
const str1 = ["Apple", "Bananna", "Orange", "Grapes"]
const str2 = ["abc" , "def", "ghi", "jkl"]
const str3 = str1.concat(str2)
console.log(str3)

//Exercise 3:
//Write a JavaScript program to sort the given array in ascending and descending order.
//const NumericArray = ['80', '9', '700', 40, 1, 5, 200];


////Ascending Order

let ascend = (a,b)=>{
        return a-b
    }

    let NumericArray = ['80', '9', '700', 40, 1, 5, 200];

    ////Descending Order

    let descend = (a,b)=>{

    }

    let NumericArray2 = ['80', '9', '700', 40, 1, 5, 200];

    console.log(NumericArray2)


//Exercise 4:
//Write a JavaScript program to add "Feb" at the index 1.
const months = ["Jan", "March", "April", "Dec"];
//Now remove "Dec" from the array and add "May", "June" in the replacement of "Dec"

months[1] = "Feb"
months.pop();
months[3]="May"
months[4]="June"
console.log(months)


//Exercise 5:
//Write a JavaScript program to join given array with " and "
let joinarr = ["Me", "my family"]

 console.log(joinarr.join(" and "))

//Exercise 6:
//Write JS Condition for the following conditions:
 //1. number greater than 2 and less than 10 then result should be "Number is between 2 and 10"
 var count = 9

//2. number greater than 10 and less than 19 then reult should be "Number is between 10 and 19"

//4. If selection is not in these values then result should be "Sorry try again"
